# TODO: generate two preprocessed TSV-files from the FakeNewsNet dataset in the following format:
#       [id, text, comments, label]
#       where id is the id of the news article, content is the content of the news article, comments is the Twitter comments of the news article, and label is the label of the news article (0 or 1).
#       The TSV-files should be saved in the same directory as this script.
#       The TSV-files should be named "politifact_no_ignore_s.tsv" and "gossipcop_no_ignore_s.tsv".
